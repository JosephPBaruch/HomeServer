# HoneyBee

> HoneyBee is my home server (named after the brand Beelink) and is running 
> Ubuntu Server. I hope to learn, have fun, and always remember that "GUI's
> are for consumers".

## Rules

1. Document Everything
> When I eventually need to go back and do it again, I know how quickly. 
2. Interact with Server as much as possible
> Do not import all work into the server and hit go. Develope within the server
> and learn the in's, out's and lessons along the way. 
3. Have Fun
> Don't focus on doing things that might prepare me for the future. Have fun and 
> treat the server like a toy, rather than a tool, often.
