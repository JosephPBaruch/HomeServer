# Remove windows and install Ubunutu Server

## Reason

I decided to go with Ubuntu server to maximize performance and to stick to some familiarity. 
Running proxmox might have been cool. Running headless will be better given the resources I have. 
Also, it will allow me to figure out manually configuring all settings through a terminal. Much more of
an opportunity to learn.
